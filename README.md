# Contributions:

This is the list of contributions according to the pull requests I have sent:

### 1. Update Clang-Repl Documentation

https://reviews.llvm.org/D152109

This patch adds support for Clang-Repl documentation, basically it provides all 
details regarding the usage of Clang-Repl. It emphasizes on the features of 
Clang-Repl that it offers to the user. The REPL nature enables users to prototype,
experiment and gives a user-friendly experience.

### 2. Add C++ InterOp Documentation Setup

https://github.com/compiler-research/CppInterOp/pull/87
https://github.com/compiler-research/CppInterOp/pull/99
https://github.com/compiler-research/CppInterOp/pull/105
https://github.com/compiler-research/CppInterOp/pull/121
https://github.com/compiler-research/CppInterOp/pull/134

**CppInterOp** is a clang-based C++ Interoperability library, which enables interoperability
with C++ code to more interactive languages like Python. The above patch adds
documentation setup for CppInterOp consisting of both sphinx and doxygen 
documentations. The above patches have covered all topics, points catering to the
development and usage of CppInterOp which include building from source(installation)
,usage, FAQs, developerâ€™s documentation, tutorials and references. The tutorials in
the docs give a detailed understanding of C++ InterOp usage, which includes C-C++
interoperability and C++-python interoperability. 

### 3. Add xeus-clang-repl Documentation Setup

https://github.com/compiler-research/xeus-clang-repl/pull/33
https://github.com/compiler-research/xeus-clang-repl/pull/34

Currently working on xeus-clang-repl docs:
https://github.com/compiler-research/xeus-clang-repl/pull/35

**Xeus-clang-repl** integrates clang-repl with the xeus protocol and is a platform 
for C++ usage in Jupyter Notebooks. The above patch adds a documentation setup 
for xeus-clang-repl consisting of both sphinx and doxygen documentations. The 
documentation covers all information regarding installation, usage, importance
and references for xeus-clang-repl. It includes tutorials portraying the different
features that can be used in xeus-clang-repl, especially the C++-python integration
executing simultaneously in the Jupyter cell with the help of magic commands( %%python).

### 4. Add xeus-cpp Documentation Setup

Currently working on deploying xeus-cpp docs:
https://github.com/compiler-research/xeus-cpp/pull/13

**Xeus-cpp** is an interactive programming environment that allows you to 
execute C++ code in a Jupyter Notebook. The above patch adds a documentation setup
for xeus-cpp consisting of both sphinx and doxygen documentations.The documentation
covers all information regarding installation, usage, importance and references
for xeus-cpp.
It includes tutorials portraying the different features that can be used in xeus-cpp,
especially the C++-python integration executing simultaneously in the Jupyter cell
with the help of magic commands(%%python).

### 5. Others

https://github.com/compiler-research/xeus-cpp/pull/12
https://github.com/vgvassilev/clad/pull/610
https://reviews.llvm.org/D156858

These are miscellaneous patches contributing to the development of current
documentation setup and content.It includes migration from v1 to v2 configuration
for readthedocs setup. Similarly, the Phabricator patch adds Clang-Repl Execution
Results by Saqib. I enabled the graphviz extension for the llvm/clang docs to
support graphviz convention for pictorial representation (Under Review).

## Conclusion

All the goals that were originally proposed have been completed to the best of my
abilities (xeus-cpp setup has not been merged yet). I will be working on improving
these things after suggestions in the upcoming weeks to make tutorials and documentation
more understandable for users. I will keep working with the compiler research group
even after the GSoC period contributing to tutorials and landing other development
patches.

I am extremely grateful to my mentors Vassil, David and for their constant
help and support in the last two months, many thanks to Vassil for providing help
and reviewing the code promptly and guiding me towards the final goal, special
thanks to Parth and Baidyanath for guiding me during the initial phase of GSoC.
The journey has been quite full of learning, experiencing new techstack and realizing
the importance of documentation and tutorials for a better user experience. I thank
Vassil and all LLVM community members for giving me this great opportunity to work
with such an evergreen and interesting community. 

Finally thanking everyone at the compiler research group for assisting throughout
the GSoC period with many new concepts and help I needed. I am also thankful to
Google for providing me the opportunity to work on this project during the summer,
which helped me learn a lot and will also surely help in my career in the future.
